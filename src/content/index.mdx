# UpRoll Deployment

<Callout type="tip">
  **Free, open‑source & self‑hosted.** UpRoll lets you spin up OP Stack chains without handing the keys to third‑party infrastructure.
</Callout>

The **UpRoll CLI Tool** by Upnode enables chain operators and developers to efficiently **configure, deploy, and manage OP Stack chains**. Choose a fully guided experience via our [Web UI](https://uproll.upnode.org/) or work entirely from the terminal with the [CLI](https://github.com/upnodedev/uproll-cli). Deployment happens locally using Docker and [Kurtosis](https://docs.kurtosis.com/).

For deployment, UpRoll uses a fork of the [optimism package](https://github.com/upnodedev/optimism-package) which provides greater levels of customisation. Unlike Conduit, which is a paid, closed-source solution that relies on third-party managed servers, UpRoll CLI Tool is free, open-source, and allows developers to deploy OP Stack chains on their own infrastructure with full transparency.

## Why UpRoll?

* **Own your infra** – zero vendor lock‑in
* **100% open‑source** – audit everything, fork anything
* **Battle‑tested stack** – based on Optimism's OP Stack and Kurtosis labs
* **Dev‑friendly** – same flow in CI/CD as on your laptop

## Quick Start
<Steps>
### Install the CLI

### Install Requirements

    [Found here](docs/requirements)

### Choose your path
   - **Web + CLI**: Visit [uproll.upnode.org](https://uproll.upnode.org) to configure your chain and run the given command for one click setup.
   - **CLI Only**: Run `uproll run` for an interactive setup using only the CLI

### Opstack Rollup Deployed
You can now query the L2 RPC at `http://localhost:8545`.

[Further commands](docs/cli) can interact with the deployment
